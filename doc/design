==General design idea

a page contains many menus, each menu has some menu items.
each menu item has a template to show the content, in other words, it is another page.

user could assign sets of products or groups to menu item, and name each set. 
while rendering page template, it would know assigned products and display them. 

section is piece of html.
a section has two kinds of section params
  1. assigned website resource, ex. menu, image, logo, flash      
  2. css stuff, positon/color/font

   

page_layout is html.
page_layout is section tree,
there are 5 contexts, each context contain proper available data_source 
  1. product,blog... list,  data_source: named_product_set
  2. product,blog... detail, data_source: current_product
  3. cart
  4. account 
  5. either
since a data_source may be contain multiple kinds of source, we need filters to specify/sort them.
ex. named_product_set, may contain group and product. 
a page_layout display group title for assigned group,   
    some sections only available under proper context.
    product_attribute
    product_images

data_sources
  named_product_set > :group > products 
                    > :product
                    
each section in page_layout own a context.  
  
  
template_theme is website resource and css. 
  
a page_layout could has many template_themes

if a template_theme apply to new website, should configure website resource first.
